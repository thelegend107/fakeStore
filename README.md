## Setup
1. Created a free tier static web app in Azure and pointed the resource to this GitHub repository
2. Under the **API** folder, an Azure Function .NET 8 project was created
3. Installed Node.js v16.x.x. Newer versions do work fine but you may need to run the API manually as SWA and Azure Functions are compatible with v16. https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v16.20.2.
4. Installed SWA CLI. Visit https://azure.github.io/static-web-apps-cli/ for more info.
	`npm install -g @azure/static-web-apps-cli`
5. Under the **APP** folder, a Vue.js project was created.
 	`npm install -g @vue/cli`
	`npm create vue@latest`

7. In the root folder, the SWA local environment was initialized using `swa init`
8. Once the local environment was initialized, the APP and the API were ran using `swa start` from the root folder
